### How do I get to run the programs? ###

* Do you have Java on your machine. If yes, that's great! 
* If no, then install JDK according to your system specifications.
* Don't want to install Java? Just here to run the program ? Don't worry then. Just search for any online Java compiler on Google.
* Steps to run the Java program:
  * If you are using an IDE like Eclipse, copy the code and paste it by selecting your package name. It will automatically create a file with the name of the public class in Java code. Just right click over the created file -> run as -> java application
  * If you want to use notepad / don't have an IDE, just open a text editor, like Notepad on window, vim on Linux and TextEdit on Mac. Copy the program and paste it in the text editor. Save the file as Main.java (considering you are using code from this repository). Now, open command prompt (cmd) on Windows, if you are Mac OS / Linux user then open Terminal. 
  To compile the program, type the following command and hit enter:
  ```java
  javac Main.java
  ```
  
You may get this error when you try to compile the program: “javac’ is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file“. This error occurs when the java path is not set in your system.

After compilation the .java file gets translated into the .class file(byte code). Now we can run the program. To run the program, type the following command and hit enter:
```java
java Main
```

Note that you should not append the .java extension to the file name while running the program.
